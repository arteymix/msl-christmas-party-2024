## Rules of the game

Participants will each be given a card containing two sequences: a messenger
RNA and a protein. On the back of the card is a reminder of biology 101 with a 
translation diagram.

Throughout the event, your goal is to encounter your protein and your coding
sequence. Upon finding a partner, write his/her number on the corresponding
slot of your card. When you find them both, you may claim a prize!

The card is yours, so carry it throughout the event.

If a table has unallocated cards, some players from that table are allowed to 
have two or more cards.

The number on the card is also used for shuffling participants around. If you
have two or more cards, you may choose any card when changing seat during the
shuffling.
