## Rules of the game

Throughout the event, your goal is to encounter your reverse complement. When you find it, the two of you may claim a prize.

A quick reminder of biology 101: A goes with T, C goes with G. The reverse complement of ATCG is CGAT.

If you move to another table, take the card with you.

If a table has unallocated cards, some players from that table are allowed to have two or more cards.

If you have two or more cards, you may choose any card when changing seat during the shuffling.
